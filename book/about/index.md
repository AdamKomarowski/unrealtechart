Welcome! 
This space is dedicated to helping developers create better games from a technological perspective. 
My main focus is on sharing content that enhances game performance, optimizes workflows, and explores advanced techniques.

Beyond that, I also aim to foster a broader knowledge base—whether it's through reading insightful books, analyzing games, discussing industry events, or participating in game jams. 
If you're passionate about pushing the boundaries of game development, you're in the right place!

# About the author

Hi, I'm Adam __Adam Komarowski__, a Technical Artist passionate about challenges and continuous learning. I love talking to people because everyone knows something I don’t—and that’s amazing!

I thrive in creating and co-leading teams, bringing energy and motivation to the group. Engaging with others, fostering collaboration, and solving conflicts and problems are things I truly enjoy.

Outside of work, I spend my time reading books, exercising, and tinkering with various projects.

Feel free to contact me at komarowski.adam<i class="fa fa-at" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #888;"></i><span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0); font-size: 0;">&nbsp;at&nbsp;</span>gmail.com
