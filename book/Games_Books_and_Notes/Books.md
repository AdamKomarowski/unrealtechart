{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/A_Playful_Production_Process.png" alt="" caption="__Book:__ A Playful Production Process" %}

__Conclusions:__

- Criticize the work, not the person

- Listen to people, clearly define what a game is and what it is not. 
  Example: This jumping mechanic is bad because... when we press space for the reaction time is too long...

- Why game is a good game: Just three impressive shoots and zero weak. .etc. if you will do three perfect shoots film or game just will be good from the start.

Assign them priority levels from A downward, then tackle them starting with the most important ones.
