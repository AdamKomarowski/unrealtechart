## Mirace Morning

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/MiraceMorning.png" alt="" caption="__Book:__ Mirace Morning" %}

__Conclusions:__

- Life is your story, your book—one that needs a hero. That hero is you. The dreams you envision won’t write themselves, but you have the power to turn them into reality. The key? A solid morning routine. Once you master that, everything else will start falling into place. Momentum will build, and before you know it, you’ll be living the story you once only imagined. Try it and see for yourself.

- The direction you’re heading is what truly matters—not where you’ve been. There are no "wrong" decisions; everything you’ve done so far has provided valuable lessons.

- Over the next year, your focus should be on becoming the kind of person who can achieve what you want. If you aim to be a 10/10 in fitness, personal life, and career, you first need to embody the habits and mindset that make it possible. Waking up at 10 AM won’t get you there—you need to align your actions with your goals.

- Real transformation happens the moment you decide to leave behind mediocrity.

- The connection between the body and mind is undeniable. If you believe you need eight hours of sleep, that’s what your body will demand. But if you reframe your mindset to function on five to six hours, your body will adapt. Your mind and body are one, and the limits you set are often the ones you choose to believe in.

- Listen to people, clearly define what a game is and what it is not.

- Why game is a good game: Just three impressive shoots and zero weak. .etc. if you will do three perfect shoots film or game just will be good from the start.
