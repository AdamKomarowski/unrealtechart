__Private Thoughts:__ 
Interesting cell shading, until the first 3 hours I felt that I just wanted to quit and not go back but after that time when I had three of my other friends the fun started, was playful. 
The last two chapters were so cool! When my team came to play was so fun but on the other hand 
when I got 3 of my teammates the game was slightly too easy compared to the first half of the game.
