## A Playful Production Process

Conclusions:

__- Criticize the work, not the person__

__- Listen to people, clearly define what a game is and what it is not.__

__Example: This jumping mechanic is bad because... when we press space for the reaction time is too long...__

__- Why game is a good game: Just three impressive shoots and zero weak. .etc. if you will do three perfect shoots film or game just will be good from the start.__
