## Lumen in Unreal Engine 5.5 

HOW ITS WORKS

Lumen is Unreal Engine 5's fully dynamic global illumination and reflections system that is designed for next-generation consoles, and it is the default global illumination and reflections system. Lumen renders diffuse interreflection with infinite bounces and indirect specular reflections in large, detailed environments at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers.

Lumen (luminous flux): 
Lumen is a total amount of light emitted by a source in all directions.

Lux (illuminance flux):
Lux is equal to one lumen per sqare meter and is the total amount of light that falls onto a surface.
