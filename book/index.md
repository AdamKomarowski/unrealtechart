__Unreal Technics__ was written to expand knowledge about game development but in a more engineered way. 

There's no the need to dive into the code to understand any fragment. However, if you want to fact-check the text (please do), there are sources and links in every chapter's footnotes.

Please don't worry that you can't grasp all the information at once. The content is divided into independent chapters and sub-chapters. You can read most of them separately if you're in a hurry.

_Note:_ The book is a work in progress. Some chapters serve as a placeholder for the future content.
